Folder: components/

Purpose:
Shared UI components and grouped subfolders used across the app.

Subfolders:

- ui/ - Design system primitives (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- layout/ - Navbar, Sidebar, and layout-related components
- forms/ - Form components and dialogs (TransactionForm, AuthDialog, EditDialog)
- charts/ - Recharts-based visualization components

Notes:

- Prefer using components from `components/ui` to keep styling consistent.
